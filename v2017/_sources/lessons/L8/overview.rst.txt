Lesson 8 overview
=================
In this week's lesson we will be introduced to the fundamental statistical ideas used in many common geological datasets and analyses.
This will be our first venture into applying our new Python skills to quantitative geoscience, and we will thus focus more on quantitative and geological concepts, rather than learning new Python skills.
That said, we will need to learn a bit about how to use the `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__ module, which is used for efficient numerical computing in Python.
NumPy is used by `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__, so you may notice that it has some similarities to a number of things you already know in Pandas.
