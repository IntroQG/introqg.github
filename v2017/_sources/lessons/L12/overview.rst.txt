Lesson 12 overview
==================
This week we will be introduced to the equations that govern the flow of viscous materials.
At depths greater than those where rocks deform in a brittle manner, crustal and mantle rocks can be treated as viscous fluids with very high viscosities.
Ice also behaves as a viscous fluid in glaciers, which will be further explored in `this weekâ€™s exercise <https://github.com/IntroQG-2017/Exercise-12>`__.
Like the previous two weeks, we will start with a `short lecture <../../_static/slides/L12/Rock-and-ice-as-viscous-materials.pdf>`__ about the equations of viscous flow and its application to modelling river erosion.
There are also :doc:`some notes <viscous-flows>` posted about viscous flow down an incline.
These are not required reading, but may be of interest for the exercise this week.
As usual we will finish with the `exercise for this week <https://github.com/IntroQG-2017/Exercise-12>`__.

Learning objectives
-------------------
After completing this week's lesson you should be able to:

- Explain why geological fluids deform in a nonlinear fashion
- Model the flow of ice in valley glaciers using viscous flow equations
