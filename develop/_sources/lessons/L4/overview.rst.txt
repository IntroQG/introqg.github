Lesson 4 overview
=================

This week we encounter our second common geoscience equation, the advection equation.
Similar to last week, we will start with a short lecture about the advection equation and its application to modelling river erosion.
There are also some notes posted for how to solve the advection-diffusion equation, which again may be of interest for the exercise this week.
As usual we will finish with the exercise for this week.

1. `Advection of Earth's surface lecture slides <../../_static/slides/L4/Advection-lecture-slides.pdf>`__
2. :doc:`Notes on solving the advection-diffusion equation <solving-advection>` (*optional*)
3. :doc:`Exercise 4 <exercise-4>`

Learning objectives
-------------------

After completing this week's lesson you should be able to:

- Explain the general concept of advection and how is it defined mathematically
- Give examples of geological processes that can be modelled using the advection equation
