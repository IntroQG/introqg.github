General hints for Exercise 2
----------------------------

Formatting numbers in Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you may have noticed, the numbers you add to your plot using the ``plt.text()`` command look kind of ugly with so many digits after the decimal place.
You can make them look a bit nicer by rounding them when you call the ``plt.text()`` command.
This is called *formatted output* in Python, and it is nice not only because it can make your text easier to read, but also because the formatting does not change the data values themselves, only their display.
To help you in formatting your output for your plots, here are some examples of how the output formatting works.

.. ipython:: python

    import numpy as np
    pi = np.pi
    print('The value of pi is', pi)
    print('The rounded value of pi is {0:.2f}'.format(pi))

Huh?
Perhaps a bit more information is needed beyond the simple example above.
Formatting text can be done in Python for any data that is a character string.
You indicate something you would like to format by enclosing it in curly brackets ``{ }`` **within the quotation marks for the character string**.
In the example above, the ``0`` indicates that this is the first value you would like to format (remember, Python indexing starts at 0).
After the ``0:``, you give how you would like to format the variable.
In this case, ``.2f`` indicates you want it to be displayed as a decimal (floating point) value with 2 digits after the decimal place.
At the end of the string, after the second quotation mark, you list ``.format()`` with the list of variables you want formated inside the parentheses.
With this in mind, let's consider another example.

.. ipython:: python

    print('The sine of pi is {0:.4f}, and the cosine of pi is {1:.1f}.'.format(np.sin(pi), np.cos(pi)))
    print('In scientific notation, the sine of pi is {0:.6e}. As an integer value it is {0:.0f}.'.format(np.sin(pi)))

Above, you see a few additional things about string formatting.
First, you see that you can give more than one variable to format by changing the number to the left of the ``:`` within the curly brackets.
In the second case, you see that you're able to format the same variable different ways within a single character string.
You may not often need to do this, but it is possible.

You can find much more about string formatting on the `Python documentation site <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/string.html#formatstrings>`__.

Hints for Problem 1

Calculating summations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are several ways in which you can calculate a summation in Python, including using the ``sum()`` function.
However, it is often better to use a ``for`` loop for summing values, particularly if you are calculating values and don't want to store their results separately from the summation.
Perhaps an example will make this clear:

.. ipython:: python

    numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    squaredSum = 0       # Set sum equal to zero before starting for loop
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        squaredSum = squaredSum + numbers[i]**2.0
    squaredSum
    sum(numbers)         # Sum of the list values
    sum(numbers)**2.0    # Square of the sum of the list values, not equal to squaredSum

The point here is that in order to calculate the sum of each value squared in a Python list, you need to calculate the square of each value in the list separately, then add those together.
You could save the squared values in a separate list and use the ``sum()`` function, but in this case it may be more clear and logical to use a ``for`` loop.
You may want to do something similar for calculating your chi squared values.

Shorthand Python notation for adding to a variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is extremely common to need to add to an existing variable in computer programs.
Because of this, there is a shorthand notation in Python for just this kind of operation.

.. ipython:: python

    number = 34
    number = number + 5
    print(number)
    number += 5
    print(number)

As you can see, ``number += 5`` is exactly the same as ``number = number + 5``, just written a bit more compactly.
As you might imagine, there are similar shortcuts for subtracting (``-=``), multiplying (``*=``), and dividing (``/=``).
