Lesson 11 overview
==================
This week we encounter our second common geoscience equation, the advection equation.
Similar to last week, we will start with a short lecture about the advection equation and its application to modelling river erosion.
There are also some notes posted for how to solve the advection-diffusion equation.
These are not required reading, but may be of interest for the exercise this week.
As usual we will finish with the exercise for this week.

Learning objectives
-------------------
After completing this week's lesson you should be able to:

- Explain the general concept of advection and how is it defined mathematically
- Give examples of geological processes that can be modelled using the advection equation
