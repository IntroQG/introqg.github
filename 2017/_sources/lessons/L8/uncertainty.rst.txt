Uncertainty
===========
Uncertainty is probably a larger issue for geoscience than for many other natural sciences, simply owing to the fact that so much of the Earth is not physically accessible to geoscientists.
A nice example of the "cost" of uncertainty is drilling for hydrocarbons in deep water.
Drill ships cost ~350 000€ per day, and operating an oil platform costs ~300 000€ per day.
A large, proven hydrocarbon resource is obviously worth a great deal of money, but as a geoscientist who might help decide where to drill, it should be clear that there is a big price to pay when you're wrong.

Some general uncertainty concepts
---------------------------------
It is not possible to make exact measurements.
For a geologist's compass, graduated in increments of 1 degree, the best measurement that can be made would be some degree value plus/minus 0.5°.
We can say the compass needle points to a given degree, but not more precicely than within one half of a degree of that value.
Even with extremely precise equipment, there will always be some uncertainty.

Our goal as geoscientists is to minimize uncertainties by making measurements that are as *precise* and *accurate* as possible (Figure 3).

*Precise* measurements have small *random errors* between measurements.
*Accurate* measurements have small *systematic errors* from the "known" values.
*Random errors* are possible to detect my repeated measurements, whereas *systematic errors* cannot be detected by repeated measurements (Figure 4).

    Here, it should be clear it is not easy to detect systematic error.

Systematic error might arise, for example, from a problem in the measurement equipment.
This is one reason why blanks and standards are used for measuring isotope concentrations when measuring geochronometer ages, for example.
